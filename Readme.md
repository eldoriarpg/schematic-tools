## What is Schematic Tools

Schematic tools is an add on for [Schematic Brush Reborn 2](https://github.com/eldoriarpg/SchematicBrushReborn).

It allows to bind previously saved brushes on any tool. The tools can be used by any player with a specific or default
permission. The tools can also have a usage limit. Tools can be also invalidated or changed after creation, allowing
easy modification afterwards.
